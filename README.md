# Home Stock Manager
This is a personal project to create an android app via Android Studio that can be used by a household to manage stock of food items in their home.

## Why have I chosen this project?
I have started this project to learn android app creation and tailored the content of the app to improve my daily life. Information from The Home Of Commons (2024) shows The average person spends Â£250 on food that ends up in the bin every year. My goal is to create an app that can be used to manage food stock which will reduce unnecessary purchasing and lower my own personal food waste.

## Page Design

There are 5 pages that are required for this project which are: Homepage, view page, search/edit page, add page and menu screen.

<b>Homepage</b>: This is the landing page to give information regarding the app.  
<b>View Page</b>: View all the items stored in the database with their item counts. Items that are marked as required will be displayed at the top.  
<b>Search / Edit Page</b>: This is a page that will allow for searching of the database and then will display the item in a manner that it can be editted or deleted.  
<b>Add Page</b>: A page to add new items to the list.  
<b>Menu Page</b>: This is a week planner for meals to further reduce wasted food by allowing extra planning.
