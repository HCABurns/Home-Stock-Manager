# Home Stock Manager
Thhis is a personal project to create an android app via Android Studio that can be used by a household to manage stock of food items in their home.

### Why have I chosen this project?
I have started this project to learn android app creation and tailored the content of the app to improve my daily life. Information from The Home Of Commons (2024) shows The average person spends Â£250 on food that ends up in the bin every year. My goal is to create an app that can be used to manage food stock which will reduce unnecessary purchasing and lower my own personal food waste.


## To do

- Learn the basics of app creation including: fragments, recyclerViews, viewAdapters and page navigation.
- Look into shared database in java - Firebase.
- Design the required elements: Lo-Fi and Hi-Fi designs, item class table, database design.
